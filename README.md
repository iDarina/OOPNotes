A Class is a template for creating objects.
Declared with class keyword followed by the class name
Body of the class is contained within brackets
Java source file name normally has same name as class
Object - Instance of a class
The object is what we get when we actually create an instance of that type.
Classes are reference types
Class variables simply hold a reference
to create an instance of a class we use new keyword
Multiple variables can reference the same instance

Classes have: 
  Fields
    -Store object state
  Methods
    -Executable code
    -Manipulate state
    -Perform operations 
  Constructors
    -Executable code
    -Runs during object creation 
    -Sets initial state



Special references:
  this
    -Implicit reference to current object
  null
    -Represents an uncreated object


Acces modifiers: 
  -Control class visibility
  -Control member visibility
  -Enable encapsulation


Fields not normally directly accessible
  -Use methods to provide access
  -Accessors retrieve fiald values
  -Mutators modify field values
